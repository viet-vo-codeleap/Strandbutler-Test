# K6 Dashboard Comprehensive Understanding Guide

The K6 dashboard provides three main tabs to analyze load test results. Each tab offers different perspectives on your test performance, helping you identify bottlenecks, performance issues, and system behavior under load.

## Dashboard Tabs Overview

1. **Overview** - High-level performance metrics and trends
2. **Timings** - Detailed timing breakdown of HTTP requests
3. **Summary** - Statistical summary of all metrics

## Understanding Percentiles (p90, p95, p99)

Percentiles are crucial statistical measures that help you understand the distribution of your performance data. They tell you what percentage of your users experience a certain response time or better.

### What Percentiles Mean:

- **p90 (90th percentile)**: 90% of all requests were faster than this value, 10% were slower
- **p95 (95th percentile)**: 95% of all requests were faster than this value, 5% were slower  
- **p99 (99th percentile)**: 99% of all requests were faster than this value, 1% were slower

### Practical Example:
If your p95 response time is 500ms, it means:
- 95% of your users experienced response times of 500ms or faster
- Only 5% of users experienced slower response times than 500ms

### Why Percentiles Matter:
- **Average** can be misleading due to outliers
- **p95** represents the experience of most users (good target for SLAs)
- **p99** captures worst-case scenarios that affect user satisfaction
- Higher percentiles help identify performance outliers and edge cases

### What Are Outliers?
**Outliers** are extreme values that are very different from the typical performance measurements. They can dramatically skew your average and give you a false picture of system performance.

**Examples of Outliers in Performance Testing:**
- Most requests take 100ms, but a few take 10,000ms (10 seconds) due to database timeouts
- 99% of requests succeed, but 1% fail due to temporary network issues
- Regular response times are 200ms, but garbage collection causes occasional 5-second spikes

**Why Outliers Matter:**
- **Average gets skewed**: If 99 requests take 100ms and 1 request takes 10,000ms, the average becomes 199ms (misleading!)
- **Real user impact**: Even if outliers are rare, they represent real users having a bad experience
- **System problems**: Outliers often indicate underlying issues (memory leaks, resource exhaustion, etc.)

**How Percentiles Handle Outliers:**
- **p95**: Ignores the worst 5% of outliers, showing typical user experience
- **p99**: Ignores only the worst 1%, capturing more edge cases
- **Average**: Gets heavily influenced by even a few extreme outliers

### Key Terms Explained:
- **TTFB (Time To First Byte)**: How long before the server starts sending response data
- **Virtual Users (VUs)**: Simulated users running your test script concurrently
- **Iteration**: One complete execution of your test script by a virtual user
- **SLA (Service Level Agreement)**: Performance targets you commit to meet
- **Connection Pool**: Reusable network connections to improve efficiency
- **SSL/TLS Handshake**: Security negotiation process for HTTPS connections
